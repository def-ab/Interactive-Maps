Key Features:
Map Display: Uses the Leaflet library to render an interactive map based on OpenStreetMap tiles.
Marker Placement: Markers represent points of interest (e.g., Taj Mahal, Gateway of India), which can be clicked to show a popup with additional information.
Interactive Popups: When a marker is clicked, it displays a name and description of the location.
Search Functionality: Users can search for specific locations by name (case-insensitive). The map will zoom to the matching location and display its marker.
Custom Styling: CSS is used to style the map and ensure itâ€™s responsive for mobile and desktop users.
Responsiveness: The map layout adjusts well across different devices and screen sizes.

Steps to Set Up:
Download or Clone the project into your local machine.
Open index.html in your browser to see the interactive map.
Search for a location in the search bar and click "Search" to see the map zoom to the location (if found).
Click on any marker to see additional information about the point of interest.
